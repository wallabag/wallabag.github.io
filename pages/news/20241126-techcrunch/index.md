Techcrunch, the famous tech blog, [wrote an article about wallabag](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/24/these-alternatives-to-popular-apps-can-help-reclaim-your-online-life-from-billionaires-and-surveillance/).

The wallabag team was pleasantly surprised to find their project highlighted in a recent TechCrunch article. Recognized as a privacy-friendly alternative to Pocket, wallabag was praised for its self-hosting capabilities and commitment to user autonomy—values at the heart of the project since its inception.

For a small, community-driven team, being featured alongside giants like Signal and Nextcloud is both unexpected and deeply motivating. Seeing our work mentioned on such a renowned platform is incredible. It’s proof that independent, ethical alternatives can stand out.

This recognition not only validates wallabag’s mission but also encourages the team to keep improving the app. We hope this spotlight will inspire more users and contributors to join our journey towards empowering individuals to take control of their data.

The future looks bright for wallabag, proving that even small projects can make a big impact in the tech world.
